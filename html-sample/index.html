          <p>
          Project created during my internship at DMDC.</br>
          It involved developing their patient portal as a cross-platform app for use on iOS, Android, and the web.</br>
          I took on the role of lead developer for the project, despite having no prior deep experience and without the ability to receive assistance from colleagues.</br>
          The project was built using Kotlin, Flutter, and Dart.</br>
          All documentation and planning were also carried out by me.</br>
          The profect has biometric security, checks and registers current language and compatible for multiple devices.</br>
          At this time, the code is not publicly available.
